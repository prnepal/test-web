 Vikram Samvat was born on the day of Gai Tihar/Aunshi Lakshmi Puja on 27th Kartik 1966 , 
 so he was named Lakshmi Prasad, but his birth name was Teerthamadhava Devkota.
 Devkota's father was a Sanskrit scholar. So he received his basic education under 
 the tutelage of his father. He Durbar High SchoolHe started his formal education.
 He studied both Sanskrit grammar and English. Devkota Darbar used to recite poetry 
 to his friends in high school. Most of his friends did not accept that those poems 
 were written by Devkota. Meanwhile, one day all the students took a test to write 
 a poem to insult him. He also wrote poetry among all the students and at the same time the teachers
 gave him the status of 'budding poet'. Devkota Tri-Chandra College in 1925Admitted in Science. After 
 completing his certificate level studies in science, he moved to the Faculty of Humanities. After 
 completing his undergraduate studies in 1929, he went to Patna, India in 1931 with the hope of pursuing 
 a master's degree in English on a scholarship. After failing to get a place in English, he studied law. 
 Due to the financial condition of his family, his desire to complete his post-graduation was incomplete.
<wbr> 
Ever since Devkota was born, many troubles kept entering his house. The managerial structure of his household
 was also very pathetic. Also, his house could not cross the poverty line. That's why he used to say when he 
 was young, 'I will study English and after studying a lot, I will earn money by teaching tuition. But he was
 sick since birth. Devkota wore Amarkosha and recited Stotramala in his childhood. He used to copy his father's
 poetry since childhood. By passing on his father's poetry, the juice of literature also started living in him. 
 His father wanted him to become a scholar.
<wbr> 
A Literary Journey Devkota was a multi-talented and extraordinary writer. There is no genre of literature that
 he has not touched in his short life, having started writing poetry from the age of ten. He has written epics, 
 khandakavyas, long descriptive poems, essays, stories, plays, songs and commentaries. Devkota's essays, which 
 feel like reading poetry, are highly commendable in terms of style and content. Devkota contributed to Nepali 
 literature by starting the romantic movement of modern Nepali language. He was the second writer born in Nepal
 to start writing epics in Nepali literature . With Devkota's innovative use of language, Nepali poetry reached 
 a new height.
<wbr> 
After abandoning the Sanskrit tradition that dominated the Nepali literary scene at that time , he inspired by 
the life of Nepali language , Lachhi Maduni, and he wrote Munamdan .(1993) wrote. He wrote long narrative poems 
in the popular Jhyaure language. Munamdan is one of the best books in the history of Nepali literature. The 2003
 film Munamadan, Nepal's official entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards, was based on
 this short story. This action received immediate recognition from the rulers of the country at that time i.e. 
 the Ranas. In Muna Madan, Muna narrates the story of Madan, a traveling merchant. Leaving his wife Muna, he leaves 
 for Tibet to earn some money. Khandakavya describes the thematic hardships of travel, the grief of separation,
 the fickleness of longing and the pangs of death. Devkotadvar's Vioganta fragment remained a best- selling work
 by Munamdan Devkota even five decades after Devkota's death. ``Munamadan'' is the first Nepali work soaked in
 Nepali people's life.Jee Vaya La Lachi Maduni is a sad song based on a Newar businessman, his mother and his wife.
 <wbr> The merchantleaves Kathmandu for work and heads for Tibet. The song begins with the wife pleading with the
 mother-in-law not to let her husband go. Devkota, who grew up in Kathmandu, heard this song sung by locals in Falcha. He was very 
 fascinated by this song and decided to rewrite it in Nepali language. As the Rana rulers banned Newari trade,
 language and literature, he changed the main character from a Newar trader to a Kshatriya (warrior class) 
 character as in the original song. Although Kshatriya people did not trade for their livelihood in those days, 
 he had to portray it as such to entice the Rana rulers.
<wbr> 
One of the most famous and frequently quoted verses from this Khandakavya goes like this.

"Kshetri's son touches this foot, he does
not touch it with anger. A man is made with a big heart, not by caste!"

As a masterpiece, Munamdan has been very popular among the general readers of Nepali literature.
 It has been the most popular Nepali book since 1993 and was also translated into Chinese. It was 
 considered a success after it was well received by China. [10]

Devkota wrote the poetic poem Pagal in 1939, inspired by his five-month stay in a mental asylum. 
This poem deals with his general mental abilities and is considered one of the best poems in the Nepali language.
<wbr> 
"Of course, my friend, I am crazy! Such is
my state.
I see the word! I
hear the scene !

had the ability to compose long epics and poems with literary complexity and philosophical 
density in a very short time, including the Shakuntal epic. His first epic poem and in the world of
 Nepali modern epic, he completed its writing within three months. Shakuntala is based on Kalidasa 's 
 famous Sanskrit drama Abhijnanashakuntalam , published in 1945 . Shakuntal demonstrates Devkota's 
 knowledge of Sanskrit and mastery of the vocabulary, which he incorporated with a heavy volume of 
 intensive words, mainly when translated into Nepali. According to the late Devkota scholar and 
 translator David Rubin, Shakuntal achieved the most. "It is, without a doubt, a remarkable work, 
 combining various elements of the classical tradition with a modern approach, cosmic symbolism,
 Corresponds to Kalidasa 's romantic comedy of earthly love that suggests liberation through the
 entanglement of sensual and sacred love. Devkota also published several collections of short poems 
 set in various traditional and non-traditional genres. Most of his poetry shows the influence 
 of English Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Coleridge. The title poem in the anthology 
 Beggar is reminiscent of Wordsworth's "The Old Cumberland Beggar." In this poem, Devkota describes 
 a beggar who, deprived of human love and material comforts, makes his way in abject poverty and destruction.
 On the other hand, the beggar is also seen as a source of compassion for those who are suffering and suffering.
 Devkota associates the beggar with the divine as the ultimate embodiment of mercy and empathy:
